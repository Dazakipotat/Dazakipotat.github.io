        <h3 style="color: white">We created this chipotle bowl project for the 1.1.9 project. In this project there are five questions about their toppings, Rice, Beans, Chicken/vegetables, Sour cream, and guac. The user decided what they want and then the turtle draws whatever the user wants. We also have an image of the plate as the background.
